Astrology widget which displays the current positions of the planets in the zodiac signs.

== Description ==

Current Planetary Positions is a WordPress plugin that adds a widget which displays the positions of the sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Chiron in the zodiac signs. From left to right, the columns display the planet's name, the degree of zodiac sign, zodiac sign symbol, zodiac sign text, the minute of degree, the second of degree, and retrograde motion (when indicated). If there appears an 'R' in the last column, then that planet is in apparent retrograde motion. The sun and moon are never retrograde. Please note: astrologers refer to all 11 of these celestial bodies as "planets" for the sake of convenience.

The zodiac sign symbols are color coded according to their element: red for fire signs, green for earth, yellow for air, and blue for water. The widget also displays the current local date and time of the viewer, as given by the viewer's browser. 

**Prerequisite:** your web host must not disable the PHP `exec()` function.

Current Planetary Positions uses the Swiss Ephemeris to get the longitude of the planets/celestial bodies. Information about the Swiss Ephemeris can be found at http://www.astro.com/swisseph/swephinfo_e.htm
